This directory contains information on how to build the
Lingeling SAT solver (http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/) with Emscripten.

Building
--------
To build Lingeling with Emscripten, simply run:

   ./build.sh

You might have to modify this file to tell it where to find
the emscripten and node.js binaries if they are not on your
path.

This will download Lingeling, patch it, build
it with Emscripten, and run a simple test.

Source
------
The patches directory contains three patches that are needed
to compile Lingeling with Emscripten.

The fix-build patch fixes one minor build error.

The parse-string patch adds functions that can parse input
from a string instead of a file.  Using the file system with
Emscripten is tricky, so it's easier to just pass in a string
representing the problem to solve.
