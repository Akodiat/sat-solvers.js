This directory contains information on how to build the
Hugs interpreter for Haskell (http://www.haskell.org/hugs/)
with Emscripten.

An online demo is available at
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~joel/share-research/hugs.html.

Building
--------
To build Hugs with Emscripten, simply run:

   ./build.sh

You might have to modify this file to tell it where to find
the emscripten binaries if they are not on your path.

This will download Hugs, patch it, and build it with Emscripten.

Source
------
Hugs compiles against Emscripten with no source changes
required.  However, Emscripten cannot seem to find the
readline library, so we modify the source to avoid linking
against it.  (We could instead modify the generated
JavaScript to include an implementation for the readline
function.)
